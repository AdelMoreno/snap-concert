		<p><strong>Use Case &#58;</strong>Since Alex is an avid music lover, she needs a website that allows her to review and share all the great concerts she is attending!</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations &#58;</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>unable to give 5 star ratings quick ratings on the current site she uses</li>
			<li>unable to link to her other social media accounts</li>
			<li>unable to comment on reviews of other users</li>
			<li>unable to do a quick review since she is busy with school and doesn't always have time to write a full one.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Interaction Flow</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Alex navigates to website in her browser</li>
			<li>small window pops up asking her for information such as email, username, and password to create an account</li>
			<li>Alex fills out the form and clicks submit</li>
			<li>the small window disappears and alex is shown the homepage containing recent concerts near her and allows her to do a quick rating of 1-5 stars</li>
			<li>Alex doesn't have time to do a full review but sees a concert she went to a few days ago she clicks on the 5-star rating</li>
			<li>A small dropdown appears with a comment box, asking if she would like to make small comment. There is also submit button for when she is done.</li>
			<li>Alex decides against a comment and hits submit</li>
			<li>Alex's rating is calculated along with other users ratings to give it an average rating</li>
			<li>Alex is satisfied that she can let others know that it is a good concert quickly, and might do a full review later, but logs off for now.</li>
		</ul>
